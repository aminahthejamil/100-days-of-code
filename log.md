# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 7 Jan, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I started on freeCodeCamp, using my phone :eyeroll:

**Thoughts** This was essentially a brush-up of previous HTML5/CSS3 knowledge, which is always helpful. I was also in the process of getting my computer fixed. Now that that's all taken care of, practicing coding is a breeze.

### Day 2: 8 Jan, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished Bootstrap and started on jQuery, finished jQuery, started and completed Tribute page. 

**Thoughts** I'd always been intrigued with Bootstrap, but had always tried to learn it in tandem with Wordpress themes, which threw me off majorly. Learning it by itself was amazing and I'm excited to do more with it in the future. It's been a long day, but I'm grateful for the experience.

### Day 3: 9 Jan, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started on my portfolio page

**Thoughts** Today was a busy day; the start of my first week back to school and acting/improv classes. I woke up extra late, trying to get back to a normal schedule after weeks of going to sleep at 3 am & sleeping till noon. Anyway, I'm trying to code a parallax page, which is proving to be more difficult than I thought. I'm going to make this right!
