# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 7 Jan, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I started on freeCodeCamp, using my phone :eyeroll:

**Thoughts** This was essentially a brush-up of previous HTML5/CSS3 knowledge, which is always helpful. I was also in the process of getting my computer fixed. Now that that's all taken care of, practicing coding is a breeze.

### Day 2: 8 Jan, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finished Bootstrap and started on jQuery, finished jQuery, started and completed Tribute page. 

**Thoughts** I'd always been intrigued with Bootstrap, but had always tried to learn it in tandem with Wordpress themes, which threw me off majorly. Learning it by itself was amazing and I'm excited to do more with it in the future. It's been a long day, but I'm grateful for the experience.
