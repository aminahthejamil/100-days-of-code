# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 7 Jan, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I started on freeCodeCamp, using my phone :eyeroll:

**Thoughts** This was essentially a brush-up of previous HTML5/CSS3 knowledge, which is always helpful. I was also in the process of getting my computer fixed. Now that that's all taken care of, practicing coding is a breeze.

### Day 2: 8 Jan, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished Bootstrap and started on jQuery, finished jQuery, started and completed Tribute page. 

**Thoughts** I'd always been intrigued with Bootstrap, but had always tried to learn it in tandem with Wordpress themes, which threw me off majorly. Learning it by itself was amazing and I'm excited to do more with it in the future. It's been a long day, but I'm grateful for the experience.

### Day 3: 9 Jan, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started on my portfolio page

**Thoughts** Today was a busy day; the start of my first week back to school and acting/improv classes. I woke up extra late, trying to get back to a normal schedule after weeks of going to sleep at 3 am & sleeping till noon. Anyway, I'm trying to code a parallax page, which is proving to be more difficult than I thought. I'm going to make this right!

### Day 4: 10 Jan, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Trying to understand jQuery so I can continue building the page

**Thoughts** I've been trying to find the best, most bug-free way to make a parallax page. It's harder than I thought. There are some CSS-only codes, some jQuery-only, and some mixed CSS and jQuery codes. This is about the time I usually lose my mind, but I'm sticking it out and pushing through!

### Day 5: 11 Jan, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've managed to use css only to get the parallax!

**Thoughts** There's a lot of stuff about css that we aren't taught. I'm learning that I need to do some more learning!

### Day 6: 12 Jan, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Trying to set up the navbar for the portfolio site. Also, learning some jQuery via A Smarter Way to Learn. 

**Thoughts**  I originally set out to use a Bootstrap navbar, but I wanted it to be sort of opaque. The active links were not working with me, but not that I think of it, I might have to go in and set the CSS for the active links themselves. We'll see. Doing the navbar with just CSS is proving more difficult than I thought. 

So, I'm in university (senioritis majoris) right now for psychology and it's our first week back. Is it bad that I'm coding during lecture? I can totally multitask! :-D

### Day 7: 13 Jan, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Attempted a CSS animal, failed. Will return. Still tweeking navbar on portfolio site 

**Thoughts**: Lots of eye rolling and such, I'm a little over the CSS animal thing at the moment and I've barely started. Oh well, I will come back to it though.
